# coursera-html-css-javascript

These are my solutions for the coding assigments in Coursera's [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers) course.

## module 2
In this module I implemented a responsive website for a fictional restaurant using HTML and CSS. The page looks nice with all different device types: mobile devices, tablets and desktops. The page can be found [here](https://johannaly.github.io/coursera-html-css-javascript/module2-solution/). Adjust the browser window size to see how it behaves with different display sizes. 

## module 3
In this module I re-implemented the website but this time I used the [Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework](https://getbootstrap.com/). In the mobile view it shows a collapsible dropdown menu. The page can be found [here](https://johannaly.github.io/coursera-html-css-javascript/module3-solution/). Adjust the browser window size to see how it behaves with different display sizes. 

## module 4
In this module I learned the basics of JavaScript. I also learned how to write modular JavaScript by using the [IIFE pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE). The solution can be found from [here](https://johannaly.github.io/coursera-html-css-javascript/module4-solution/). It only prints to the console so you have to use the developer tools in your browser to see how it works.

## module 5
In this final module I got a brief introduction to Ajax and JSON. The task was to fill in missing pieces in the code to randomize what is shown in the specials category. The solution is available [here](https://johannaly.github.io/coursera-html-css-javascript/module5-solution/). Just click on to specials tile at the bottom of the page and each time the specials should be different.
